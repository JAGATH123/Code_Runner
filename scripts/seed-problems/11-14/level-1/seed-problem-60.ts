      description: `The signal from Erevos-7 strengthens. Coordinates are computed and plotted as safe warp jumps across interstellar space. But before the journey begins, NOVA-12 must extract critical minerals from a nearby asteroid to fuel the long voyage.

Astra: *"Commander, we've located a mineral-rich asteroid in our path. We need to deploy the mining drill to extract fuel cores from varying depths. The drill must operate in precise 20-meter intervals, monitoring for mineral layers at 60 meters and reaching the core at 100 meters. Use range() to control the drilling sequence."*

Your mission is to simulate the asteroid mining drill operation for NOVA-12's resource extraction.`,

      question: `Commander, initiate the Asteroid Mining Drill Simulation!

Your program should execute the drilling sequence:
- Print "Starting asteroid drilling sequence..."
- Create a for loop using range(0, 120, 20) to drill from 0 to 100 meters in steps of 20
- Inside the loop, print "Drilling depth: [depth] meters" for each depth
- Add conditional checks:
  - When depth equals 60: print "Mineral layer detected – slowing rotation speed."
  - When depth equals 100: print "Core reached – collecting samples."
- After the loop completes, print "Extraction complete – returning to orbit."

This demonstrates range() with start, stop, and step parameters combined with conditionals.`,

The third parameter (20) is the step size, which controls how much to increment each iteration. range(0, 120, 20) generates: 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 (stops before 120). Print "Starting asteroid drilling sequence..." before the loop. Inside the loop: for depth in range(0, 120, 20):. Print "Drilling depth:", depth, "meters" for each iteration. Use if depth == 60: to check for mineral layer, then print "Mineral layer detected – slowing rotation speed." Use if depth == 100: to check for core, then print "Core reached – collecting samples." After the loop completes, print "Extraction complete – returning to orbit." This combines range() step control with conditional logic for event detection at specific depths.`
