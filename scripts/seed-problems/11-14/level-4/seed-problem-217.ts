      question: `Build the Galactic Log Keeper system - a comprehensive mission logging system where spikes intensify and clean segmentation of logs becomes critical for quick recovery. The team reviews earlier trials and creates a Log Keeper utility with helper functions to append block entries and read them back by section for fast triage.

Complete 6 steps:

Step 1: Create and Write Log Header - Create "galactic_log.txt" in write mode and add the header "--- Galactic Mission Log ---" (with newline). Print "Log initialized"

Step 2: Add Mission Entries - Prepare a list of 3 mission entries: "Navigation system initialized\\n", "Resource scan complete\\n", "Signal received from satellite\\n". Use writelines() to write them all at once. Print "Mission entries added"

Step 3: Read Full Log - Use read() to get the complete content and print it exactly as stored

Step 4: Read Logs Line by Line - Use readline() twice to skip the header and read the second line. Print "Second entry: [content]" where [content] is stripped

Step 5: Display All Lines with Numbering - Use readlines() to get all lines. Print each with format "Log 1: [content]", "Log 2: [content]", etc. (strip each line)

Step 6: Add a User Log Entry - Append the text "Emergency alert activated" to the file (with newline). Print "New log saved successfully"`,      sample_input: '',

      case_overview: `Cadets become the official record-keepers of the Galactic Explorer Crew. Build the Galactic Log Keeper, a system that securely records and retrieves mission data throughout the journey. This log helps mission control track progress, decisions, and alerts in real-time. Using all file handling skills, build a system that writes entries, reads specific logs, and displays the full log history.`,
      case_explanation: `Implement 6 comprehensive steps combining all file handling functions: Create log header with write(), add multiple entries with writelines(), read complete logs with read(), process line-by-line with readline(), display numbered lists with readlines(), and append new entries dynamically. This system demonstrates mastery of all Python file handling functions for mission-critical data management.`,
