# Python Error Reporting Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the Python code execution system to provide detailed, user-friendly error messages with line numbers and specific error types.

## What Was Changed

### 1. New Error Parser Module
**File**: `src/lib/python-error-parser.ts`

This module parses Python error output and extracts:
- **Error Type**: The specific Python error (SyntaxError, NameError, TypeError, etc.)
- **Line Number**: Which line the error occurred on (when available)
- **Friendly Message**: User-friendly explanation of what went wrong
- **Suggestion**: Actionable advice on how to fix the error

### 2. Integrated Error Parsing
**File**: `src/lib/gpu-container-pool.ts`

Modified the code execution flow to:
- Parse stderr output through the new error parser
- Format errors before sending to frontend
- Provide context-aware suggestions for common errors

## Error Types Handled

### Syntax Errors
- Missing quotes, brackets, or parentheses
- Invalid Python syntax
- Unexpected EOF

**Example Output**:
```
Line 5: SyntaxError

Syntax error: Invalid Python syntax. Check for missing colons (:), parentheses, or quotes.

Suggestion: Double-check your Python syntax. Common issues: missing colons after if/for/while/def, unclosed parentheses, or incorrect operators.
```

### Indentation Errors
- Unexpected indents
- Missing indents after colons
- Inconsistent indentation

**Example Output**:
```
Line 3: IndentationError

Indentation error: Unexpected indent found. Check your spacing at the beginning of the line.

Suggestion: Make sure your code uses consistent indentation (spaces or tabs, not mixed).
```

### Runtime Errors

#### NameError
**Example Output**:
```
Line 2: NameError

Name error: name 'undefined_var' is not defined. You're trying to use a variable or function that doesn't exist or hasn't been defined yet.

Suggestion: Define the variable or function 'undefined_var' before using it, or check for typos in the name.
```

#### TypeError
**Example Output**:
```
Line 3: TypeError

Type error: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str. You're using the wrong type of data for this operation.

Suggestion: Check that you're using compatible data types in your operation (e.g., don't try to add a string to a number).
```

#### ZeroDivisionError
**Example Output**:
```
Line 4: ZeroDivisionError

Division by zero: You can't divide by zero in mathematics or programming.

Suggestion: Avoid dividing by zero. Check your calculations or add a condition to prevent this.
```

### Other Handled Errors
- **ValueError**: Invalid values for operations
- **IndexError**: List index out of range
- **KeyError**: Dictionary key not found
- **AttributeError**: Object doesn't have requested attribute
- **ImportError/ModuleNotFoundError**: Module cannot be imported
- **TimeoutError**: Code execution exceeded time limit

## Benefits for Students

1. **Clear Line Numbers**: Students immediately know where the problem is
2. **Friendly Language**: Errors explained in beginner-friendly terms
3. **Actionable Suggestions**: Specific advice on how to fix each type of error
4. **Educational Value**: Students learn about error types while debugging

## Testing

Test the error reporting using the test script:
```bash
npx tsx test-error-parser.js
```

Or test via API:
```bash
# Test with NameError
curl -X POST http://localhost:9002/api/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code":"print(undefined_var)","input":"","language":"python"}'

# Test with SyntaxError
curl -X POST http://localhost:9002/api/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code":"print(\"Hello World\"","input":"","language":"python"}'
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Highlight the exact character/token where the error occurred
2. Provide code snippets showing the problematic line
3. Add "Did you mean...?" suggestions for common typos
4. Include links to Python documentation for each error type
5. Track common student errors for curriculum improvement

## Technical Details

### Regex Pattern Compatibility
The error parser uses `[\s\S]` instead of the `s` flag for regex patterns to maintain ES2015 compatibility while still matching across multiple lines.

### Error Parsing Flow
1. Code executes in Docker container
2. Python stderr output captured
3. Error parser analyzes stderr with regex patterns
4. Structured error object created with type, line, message, and suggestion
5. Formatted error message sent to frontend
6. Frontend displays error with proper styling

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/python-error-parser.ts` - New file
- `src/lib/gpu-container-pool.ts` - Added error parsing integration
- `test-error-parser.js` - Test script for error parser
